# site
My internet blog. Random stuff
* The [public folder](https://github.com/jiajingan/jiajingan.github.io) is a submodule that is deployed on [jackiegan.com](https://jackiegan.com/)
* The site is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I used theme: [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)
# installation
```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 <url>
```
* `-j8` is an optional performance optimization that became available in version 2.8, and fetches up to 8 submodules at a time in parallel â€” see `man git-clone`.
