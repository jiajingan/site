- In this past couple OAs (IBM, Citizens Bank just to name a few), I have been taking L's on the database questions. As a CS major in my university, SQL is not part of our curriculum. So I decided to make this post to go over some basic concepts in SQL.
---
- SQL is a query language and data is usually stored in tables
- After some research, I have decided to use MySQL since it is the most popular database. In the future I will also cover some PostgreSql
- Resources 
    - https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
    - https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial
    - https://www.sql-practice.com/

- Basic concepts 
    - SELECT - extracts data from a database
        - ```SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;```, CustomerName and City are the headers, Customers is the table name
        - ```SELECT DISTINCT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;```, the distinct keyword will select unique values from customername(e.g. joe will not appear twice in the query).
        - ```SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico';```, this query will select everything from Customers tables where country is Mexico.
        - syntax for select`SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;`
        - syntax for select with distinct `SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;`
        - syntax for select with where `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
        - we can also used key words like `or`, `and`, and `not`
        - syntax for where and `WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;`, for where or `WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;`, for where not `WHERE NOT condition;`
        - syntax `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;`, ASC(ascending) is default and DESC(descending) needs manual input
    - UPDATE - updates data in a database
        - `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...WHERE condition;`, use set to pick columns and where to select specific condition
    - DELETE - deletes data from a database
        - `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
        - `DELETE FROM table_name;` deleting all the data but not the table
    - INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
        - syntax `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);` , you don't always need to list out the columns
    - Functions 
        - MAX(), MIN(), COUNT(), AVG(), SUM()
        - example: `SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
    - LIKE - check patterns 
        - `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;`
        - please refer to other resources in the pattern, there is also wildcard patterns
    - IN, BETWEEN, ALIASES
        - IN selects a certain value, `WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);`
        - BETWEEN is between 2 values, `WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;`
        - ALIASES is just shorting the name, `SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;`
    - JOINS 
        - There is 4 different types of joins
        - INNER JOIN is like intersection of a two sets
        - LEFT JOIN is getting the insection and the left
        - RIGHT JOIN is getting the insection and the right
        - FULL JOIN is getting like union, group everything together
        - example: `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;` 
    - GROUP BY - group into summary rows
        - We can also use functions in these
        - example: `SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM CustomersGROUP BY Country;`
    - CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
        - `CREATE DATABASE databasename;`
    - CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
        - `CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype, column2 datatype,column3 datatype, ....);`
    - ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
        - syntax `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;` or you can also drop columns
    - DROP TABLE - deletes a table
        - `DROP TABLE table_name;`
        - `TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;` delete database not table itself
    - CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
        - syntax `CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);`
        - creates a index column
    - DROP INDEX - deletes an index
        - different server has different way to drop index
        - syntax for MySQL `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX index_name;`
- SQL is not case sensitive 
- SQL statements ends with a semicolon
