Back in my sophomore year I got rejected by 3 internships (or more) because my OOP skills weren't good enough. I want to make this post to remind myself I know the concepts.

***Java Basic Concepts***
- What is a class?
    - A class is a blueprint of anything, I mean literally anything. You can also have nested class too (this is too advanced for now). For example, a car has an engine, mpg, top speed, gear type, gear amount, and etc but the class will hold all of theses. A class holds different types of fields(states) and methods(functions).
- What is an object?
    - An object in Java are the attributes of differents types of function. For example, a car has an engine, mpg, top speed, gear type, gear amount, and etc but the class will hold all of theses. For example, there is a toyota camry, honda civic, and etc. You can use the class to make an object.
    - Note: instance and object are the same thing
- What is interface?
    - An interface is an blueprint of a class. It can only hold static constants and abstract methods. These type of methods are only used to define things but cannot hold values. For example, a car interface would consist types of methods like public float mpg, public int gearType = "" and etc.
- What is a Package?
    - A package in java is like a library in other languages. You can import a class that has functions that can write codes more efficiently. For example, 'import java.util.Scanner;', this only imports the scanner class from util library. You can also import everything from util by 'import java.util.*;'
- What does static mean?
    - Static keyword means it belongs to a certain member or class type. For example, you can define a car brand like toyota in car class. They are global variables for a class. So it means you can access it without using the object compared to just declaring string make. There is static blocks, variables, methods, and classes.

***Pros and Cons of OOP*** 
- Pros
    - You can build programs that are modular based and structured
    - Very enterprise friendly like Java (Jobs!!!!)
    - Everything is an object
    - Low development cost
    - I heard it's more secure?
- Cons
    - A lot of boilerplate code
    - Desigining good OOP structure can be hard, and might shoot yourself in the foot sometimes
    - Can be slow sometimes
    - Code can get messy
    - Everything is an object
