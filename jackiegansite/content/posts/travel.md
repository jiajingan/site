In the last few years, I haven't been traveling internationally or domestically due to the unspoken deadly disease :mask:. In this travel pt1, I want to share some of my favorite places that I have traveled before the pandemic and places I have traveled this summer.

### Atlanta, GA (ATL)
I have to admit I had a great time at Atlanta with friends. There is a lot to the city, a lot of places to visit such as Atlanta Botanical Garden, World of Coca-Cola, Georgia Aquarium and so on. The Botanical Garden is HUGE!!!! Get yourself a good pair of walking shoes before you go there. The weather is relatively warm during the summer, great food ([Atlanta Breakfast Club](https://www.atlantadowntown.com/go/atlanta-breakfast-club)). Midtown looks very nice, it has it's own tech hub going on with all the big corps. Georgia Tech is also there. There is a lot of see and a lot to do.\
rating: ★★★★☆ 

### Charlotte, NC (CLT)
Charlotte was quite the unique experience for me. It the kind of town you need to know where to go, because their center city(uptown) is pretty dead during the weekend(just a bunch of corporate offices). Places like South End, Optimist Hall and Noda was pretty interesting. However, Charlotte is a big city, there is a lot to do if you are willing to drive a bit. If you ever go to Charlotte, must try out [Boardwalk Billy's](https://boardwalkbillys.com/) and [Cookout!!](https://cookout.com/). The food scene is pretty mediocre, I haven't found anything that was spectacular. I feel like this city has a lot of hidden gems that I haven't explored yet.\
rating: ★★★☆☆ 

### Melbourne, FL (MLB)
I spent a good portion of my life in Melbourne FL during the summer. It's more known as a beach town an hour outside of Orlando. I think it's a great place to come once in a while for vacation. Beautiful ocean, quiet, hearing the ocean washing up the shore was soul soothing. The beaches is not crowded!!! Highly recommend to walk along the beach by sunset. The food scene is pretty mediocre like worse than CLT. You will find a lot of older gentlemen and ladies in the area. There is only one place I can really recommend, [MisterO1](https://www.mistero1.com/).\
rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2.5, there is no half a star)

### Singapore (it's a country)
I went to singapore a couple years ago, I think it's probably one of the cleanest and nicest places I have ever been to. It's a hidden gem in Asia. Everyone talks about Korea, Japan, Thailand. I haven't been to those places but I think Singapore is unique for itself. It's clean, well organized, great food. Their architecture is top notch, very modern and well designed. The food scene is awesome, you can just go to some random hawker stand, you should be able to find good food. Very small and compact city. It's just very expensive.\
